This just a repo of what i learned from books and personal project 



Premier_league(version1):
  This is my first project.
  I got this data set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saife245/english-premier-league/data?select=final_dataset.csv.This project just predicts the result of the   matches before the actual match.
  My target   varible is FTR(FullTimeResult), this dataset was designed for sports betting so it had a lot of betting related      data so i dropped them all and other columns that were not required.
  After dropping   all the columns my features were HomeTeam,AwayTeam,FTR(y).
  I used the 18-19,19/20,20-21 as the training dataset and used 21-22 as test dataset. I converted the HomeTeam and AwayTeam columns into numbers using label encoding.
  This was a classification problem so i used a RandomForestClassifier. The model's accuracy was ~0.41.
  Next steps: implement rolling features to improve accuracy
